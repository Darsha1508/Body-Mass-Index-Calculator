Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person’s height and weight. It is used to know whether the person is undeweight, healthy or overweight. The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person’s weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.

A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9. BMI applies to most adults whose age is between 18-65 years.
